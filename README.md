Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning and statistics used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It's commonly used for predictive modeling, where the goal is to predict the value of the target variable based on the input features.

Key Concepts of Linear Regression:
Linear Relationship:

Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. This means that the target variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the input features.
Equation of a Line:

In simple linear regression (one feature), the relationship is modeled as:
